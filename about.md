My name is Mo Aslam and I live in the picturesque small town of Aurora, Ontario Canada. I am an Oracle certified developer with skills in web and database development. My development experience includes working with multiple programming languages on various platforms, including but not limited to RPG, C/C++, Java, C#, PL/SQL, JavaScript, PHP, Swift, Dart & Flutter and Python.
I work in the Network Operations Center department for a major Canadian telecommunications company. This position has provided me with the opportunity of working with various networking technologies and currently I am part of a team focused on automation and intelligent software systems development, using Operations Orchestration, Machine Learning, Big Data and Business Intelligence technologies. Due to dynamic business needs, I have worked on developing Splunk dashboards, Microfocus Operations Orchestration Automation flows, intranet search and web portals, data analysis and visualization solutions using industry standard tools like Power BI, UIPath and OO Studio.
