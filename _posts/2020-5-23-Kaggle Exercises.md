**Intro to Machine Learning**

This module contains the use of following Machine Learning commands and concepts:
- Decision Trees
- Pandas DataFrame: A structure that handles 2 dimensional data like an SQL table or Excel sheet.
- Pandas data analysis and description methods: describe(), head(), columns etc
- Selecting ML features and prediction values
- Scikit-learn DecisionTreeRegressor 
- Fitting the model and making predictions
- Comparing the error calculations and selecting ideal number of max_leaf_nodes for DecisionTreeRegressor
- Using Random Forest algorithm to minimize error
